# ConquerRebuild
Conquer's design and content is built to mimic a free Bootstrap template from templatemo website. This is a demo page by Cayla Savitzky, built without any framework.
One of the additional goals of this project is to use as little Javascript as possible by making the best use of CSS3 and HTML5.
